# Decentralized Voting Application on Ethereum Blockchain

Welcome to our decentralized voting application repository! This project leverages Ethereum blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent voting system. Built with Solidity for smart contracts and Next.js for the front end, this application ensures the integrity and immutability of the voting process.

## Features
- **Decentralization:** Eliminates the need for a central authority, ensuring trustless and transparent voting.
- **Security:** Utilizes Ethereum blockchain for tamper-proof transactions and smart contracts for secure execution of voting processes.
- **Transparency:** Provides a transparent ledger of all voting activities, accessible to all participants.
- **Accessibility:** Offers a user-friendly interface built with Next.js, making it easy for voters to participate in the process.

## Tech Stack
- **Solidity:** Smart contract language for Ethereum blockchain development.
- **Next.js:** React framework for building the front end of web applications.
- **npm:** Package manager for installing project dependencies.
- **Hardhat:** For testing purposes.
